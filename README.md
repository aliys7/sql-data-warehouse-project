# Data Architecture

The data architecture for this project follows the **Medallion Architecture** (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers):

## High-Level Architecture

![Data Architecture](docs/data_architecture.png)

1. **Bronze Layer**:  Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database. </br>

2. **Silver Layer**: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis. </br>

3. **Gold Layer**: Gold Layer: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics. </br>
